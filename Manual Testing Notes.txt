Software Testing Approaches 

					S/W  Testing
					

		Verification			Validation
		
	Static Testing				Dynamic Testing

	-Reviews
	   - Requirment Reviews
	   - Design Reviews
	   - Code Reviews
	   - Test case Review

	-WalkThrough (KT's 
				  Knowledge Transfer)




Static Testing	:


It is a process of checking are we developing right s/w or not

Review : Examing a project related work is called a Review

Types of Reviews :

1. Requirement Reviews : these reviews are carried out by domain experts to find 
mistakes at requirements

2. Design Reviews : these reviews are carried out by technical experts (System Architects 
or Solution Architects) to find mistakes at design levels

3. Code Reviews : these reviews are carried out by Senior/Principal Developers

4. Test case Reviews : these reviews are carried out by senior testers (test lead) to make 
sure prepared test cases are enough to test the project or not.

Formal Reviews :

If any review activity carried out by following proper review procedures and documentation

Best examples : Inspections and Audit


Inspection : if a formal review is carried out while executing a tasks

Audit : if a formal review is carried out after completion of tasks

WalkThrough :

Knowledge Transfer sessions (KT's )  are called WalkThrough's 


-------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Testing

Whitebox Testing


Unit Testing and Integration Testing collectively called as Whitebox Testing

Unit Testing :

A smallest part in the source code of application such as program , functions ,methods , procedure are called 
Units. Testing conducted on these units to make sure developed code is corerct or not is called Unit Testing



Integration Testing:

once all units are tested , programmer/developer combine all units and check over all output at code level.


Blackbox Testing :

Testing conducted on developed application by testers and by end users to make sure developed 
application is working as per client/customer buisness requirements

System testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

System testing: 

It is a process of validating functional and non-functional requirements of the system
in customer buisness point of view

-----------------------------------------------
Funtional System Testing Types 
-----------------------------------------------

1) Smoke Testing :

500 TC  == All Test cases

50 TC  == Key/Critical/major Test Cases (choosen by Test Lead)

It is a kind of quick test or rough test performed on the given application/build to decide
whether it is eligible for further detailed testing.

Objective of smoke Testing :

smoke testing is carried to make sure whether the given application/build is testable or not.
Not to find defects.

2) Formal Testing :

If we test a s/w application by following proper procedures and proper documentation.

In simple words , writing test cases and executing test cases is called Formal Testing.

It is recommended for maintenance projects.

3) Adhoc Testing : 

If we test a s/w application without following any proper procedures and proper documentation.

note :
genrally , we do adhoc testing for small size applications/projects


-> adhoc testing is recommended maintenance projects after doing formal testing.

4) Priority based Testing :

It is a process of deciding what to test first and what to test next , what to test last

5) ReTesting :

It is a process of validating reported defects are correctly resolved or not in modified.

6) Regression Testing 

It is a process of identifying various functionalities in a modified build , whether 
there is chance of getting side effects.

what is the difference b/n ReTesting and Regression Testing ?

Retesting is performed on the modified build to make sure reported defects are correctly 
resolved or not

Regression Testing is performed on the modified build to determine side effects which may 

occur because of bux fix.


7) Sanity Testing :

It kind of testing done for a particular functionality deeply.

It is subset of Regression testing .

Special Function Testing Types :

1. Benchmark Testing
2. Explorating Testing 
3. Monkey Testing 


*********************************************
Non Functional Testing
*********************************************



TEsting performed to check reponsivenes , stability and security etc  aspects are called
Non Functional Testing.

1) GUI
2) Usability
3) Performance
   - Load Testing
   - Stress Testing
   - Volume Testing
4) Security
5) Compatability
6) Internationalization
7) Localization
8) Installation
9) Recovery 


1) GUI or UI (User Interface ) :

It is a process of checking user interfaces (anything on web page like button , 
textboxes , text etc )
are professionally design or not 

2) Usability :

It refers to testing an application to determine it's ease to use or 
level of user-friendliness

3) Performance

  * Reponsiveness
  * stability

   - time (response time)
   - speed (prcoessing time)
   - user data volume ( concurrent user volume)

i)Load Testing
ii) Stress Testing
iii) Volume Testing
   
Tools like jmeter, load runner , Neo Load , web load etc ..

Load Testing : 

Testing the response time of system under different loads

we increase the load gradually and test the s/m

Stress Testing:

Suddenly increasing  the load and checking the stability

Volume Testing :

Here we test user data volume and checking the stability

Security Testing :

Testing security ascepts.

Globalization or Internationalization or I18N  Testing :

It is a process of checking end user having a choice to configure different lang options

(currency , date and time format )

Recovery Testing :

It's a process of chekcing how does our application handling unexpected behaviour like 

power failure , system crash , internet issues etc ..

 
Installation : 

It's process of checking are we able to install the software successfull or not 
as per guideliness given in installation documentation

UnInstallation : 


It's process of checking are we able to uninstall the software successfull 
and also data clean 


*********************************************
User Acceptance Testing :
*********************************************

Testing carried out by the end user on the delivered product to make sure
wheter it is ready for live production or not.

This UAT is carried out in two Stages :

1. Alpha Testing
2. Beta Testing

Alpha Testing : It is first level of acceptance testing 
carried out at company premises


Beta Testing : It is last level of acceptance testing 
carried out at customer premises

Objective of UAT :

User Acceptance Testing carried out by customer to build the confidence on the devlivered 
application before going to live.

not to find defects.
